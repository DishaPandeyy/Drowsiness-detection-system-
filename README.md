# Human_drowsiness_detection_system-
In this project, we have build a human drowsiness detection system that will detect if the eyes of the user are close for too long and infer if the user is sleepy or inactive.  The  drowsiness detection system can be used  as a user in a two ways:- 
1. It can be a safety technology that can prevent accidents that are caused by drivers who fell asleep while driving.  
2. It can also be used by the students who are working on the laptop/pc for too long  and fell asleep while  doing work.

Drowsiness detection systems represent a critical advancement in enhancing road safety by addressing the risky issue of drowsy driving. These systems have the potential to save lives and prevent accidents, but they also come with their own set of limitations and areas for improvement. Drowsiness detection systems are not only relevant to the field of automotive safety but also have practical applications and implications for students and young adults. These systems offer several key takeaways for students.
